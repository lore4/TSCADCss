# TSCADCss
TSCADCss is an header file to use on-board ADC on beaglebone black. It is developed with Code Composer Studio and use examples based on TI PRU software support package.

# Current Status
- It compiles! 
- REVISION and ADCSTATS were succesfully read!
- STEPs (i.e. config and delay registers), CTRL, STEPENABLE were succesfully used!
- ADC is sampling, but returns incorrect values... ouch!

P.S. Example's folder tree must be pruned!
